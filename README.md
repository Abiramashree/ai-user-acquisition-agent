- Reflects on outputs to suggest emotionally strong variants

- Stores feedback for future memory and iterative improvement

This project is a basic starting point intended to help developers and enthusiasts understand how to structure agentic AI logic in a practical context. Itâ€™s not production-ready but offers a modular foundation that can be extended or refined based on real-world needs
